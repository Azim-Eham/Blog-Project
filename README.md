# Blog Website with Admin Panel

A fully functional blog website built with **React**, featuring:
- üõ†Ô∏è CRUD operations for blog posts
- üîê Admin-only dashboard and controls
- üåô Dark mode toggle using Tailwind CSS v4.1
- üîÑ Redux Toolkit for global state management
- üîó React Router v6 for navigation
- üíæ localStorage for theme and content persistence

While building this project, I sought guidance and explored various resources to improve my understanding of certain concepts. The following README will describe the features I implemented, the technologies I used, and what I learned in the process.

## Project Overview

This is a **Blog Website** with both a **public-facing blog** and an **admin panel** to manage content. The goal was to create a dynamic web application using React, Redux, and local storage for persistence. I designed and implemented most of the features myself, but I did seek advice and suggestions on best practices from tutorials and forums.

## Features

- View all blog posts on the home page
- Read individual posts in detail
- Admin panel to create, edit, and delete posts
- Simple login system for admin access
- Dark mode toggle (theme persists using `localStorage`)
- Fully responsive design with Tailwind CSS v4.1

## Technologies Used

- **React**: To build the user interface and manage component state.
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage global state for the blog posts.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing between the public blog and admin panel.
- **Local Storage**: Used to simulate data persistence.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To make the website visually appealing and responsive and for dark mode.

## Lessons Learned
While working on this project, I encountered and overcame several challenges that helped me grow as a developer:

- **State Management**: I learned how to use Redux Toolkit for managing complex state in a React application. This was especially useful for handling the list of posts and the admin panel state.

- **Routing**: By implementing React Router, I got hands-on experience with dynamic routing, which allowed me to create a seamless navigation experience between the blog and the admin panel.

- **Forms Handling**: I faced challenges with form handling (e.g., adding, editing, and deleting posts), but through careful planning and research, I implemented efficient solutions that work seamlessly.

- **Persistence with Local Storage**: I initially found simulating a backend with Local Storage tricky, but I learned how to manage data persistence across sessions without the need for a real server.

- **UI/UX**: I spent a lot of time perfecting the user interface to ensure it‚Äôs both functional and visually appealing. I used Tailwind CSS for styling, which helped me create a responsive and modern design.

Throughout this project, I sought guidance from tutorials and online resources to learn new techniques and approaches. This was a valuable learning experience, and I feel more confident working with React, Redux, and other modern web technologies.
